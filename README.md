This project explores the relationship between trader performance and market sentiment using historical trading data and the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index. The analysis aims to uncover patterns that inform smarter trading strategies. Two primary datasets were used: one containing detailed trader-level information such as account ID, trade side (BUY/SELL), execution price, trade size, and closed profit or loss (PnL); and another providing daily sentiment classification (e.g., Fear, Greed, Extreme Fear). After preprocessing—such as timestamp normalization, sentiment mapping, and handling of null values—the datasets were merged to align each trade with the corresponding market sentiment.

Using the cleaned dataset, various insights were derived. The analysis showed that trader profitability tends to be higher during "Greed" and "Extreme Greed" sentiments, while "Fear" and "Extreme Fear" often coincide with negative average PnL, particularly for long (BUY) trades. Traders generally place larger trades during greed phases, indicating higher confidence, while trade sizes shrink during fear, reflecting risk aversion. Trade direction analysis revealed a higher tendency to SELL (short) during Fear and to BUY during Greed. Additionally, volatility (measured via PnL standard deviation) was found to be highest during Extreme Fear, signaling increased risk in such market conditions. The project also included time-based analysis, such as daily net PnL trends and a review of top-performing accounts across different sentiments.
